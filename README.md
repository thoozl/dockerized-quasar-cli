This is an official git repo for the Docker image hosted on Docker Hub at [thoozl/quasar-cli](https://hub.docker.com/r/thoozl/quasar-cli/). However, it should be noted that it is not officially tied to Docker, [Quasar](https://quasar-framework.org/), VueJS, or any other individual or entity aside from Thoozl Inc. 

**Full Disclaimer:** Thoozl Inc. is not affiliated with Quasar, VueJS, NPM, Alpine Linux, Docker, or any other organization mentioned in this repository unless explicitly stated otherwise.

That out of the way, we here at Thoozl are fans of Open Source software, and we realized early on that the images for [quasar-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quasar-cli)  was seriously out of date, so we built our own on top of Alpine Linux. The tag on the image corresponds to the version number of quasar-cli.

Feel free to use or modify our Dockerfile however you wish so long as you comply with all the liscenses bundled with the corresponding software!
